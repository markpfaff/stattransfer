<p class=rvps6><span class=rvts2>Circle Systems grants you the right to load and use one copy of the software on a single computer (your “Dedicated Computer”). You may transfer the software to another single Dedicated Computer provided you remove all copies of the software from the first computer when you install it on the other computer. If one individual uses the Dedicated Computer more than 80% of the time that it is in use, then that individual may also load and use the software on that individual</span><span class=rvts10>&#8217;</span><span class=rvts2>s portable or home computer.&nbsp; You may also make a copy of the software for backup or archival purposes. If you receive a copy of the software electronically and on disk, you may use the disk copy for archival purposes only.</span></p>
<p class=rvps7><span class=rvts2>Copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaty protect this software. Copyright law prohibits you from making any other copy of the software and user manual without the permission of Circle Systems. You may not alter, modify, or adapt the software or user manual, or create any derivative works based on them. Circle Systems distributes the software in computer executable form only, and does not allow user access to the underlying source code and data. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software to gain access to such code and data, except to the extent applicable law expressly permits such activity. Decompiling or disassembling the software may also violate the software</span><span class=rvts10>&#8217;</span><span class=rvts2>s copyright.</span></p>
<p class=rvps8><span class=rvts2>You may not sublicense, sell, rent, lend, lease, sublicense, or give away the software to others.

<p class=rvps9><span class=rvts2>Any unauthorized copying, distribution, or modification of the software will automatically cancel your license to use the software and violate the software</span><span class=rvts10>&#8217;</span><span class=rvts2>s copyright.</span></p>

<p class=rvps10><span class=rvts2>Circle Systems warrants that the software will perform in substantial compliance with the specifications set forth in the user manual provided with the software, provided that it is not modified and it is used on the computer hardware and with the operating system for which it was designed. Circle Systems also warrants that any disk media and printed user manuals it provides are free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. These warranties are limited to the 30-day period from your original purchase. If you report in writing within 30 days of purchase a substantial defect in the software</span><span class=rvts12>&#8217;</span><span class=rvts13>s</span><span class=rvts2> performance, Circle Systems will attempt to correct it or, at its option, authorize a refund of the amount you originally paid for the software. If you return faulty media or a printed user manual during this period, along with a dated proof of purchase, Circle Systems will replace it free of charge. You must insure items being returned, since Circle Systems does not accept the risk of loss or damage in transit.</span></p>
